# Research Abstract: Airtime-Based Soft Admission Control for Dense Wi-Fi 6 WLANs

**Title:** Enhancing QoS in Dense IEEE 802.11ax Networks: A Dynamic Airtime-Based Soft Admission Control Mechanism

**Abstract:**

Even with the advanced capabilities of IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), dense Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) often struggle to meet the strict latency demands of modern applications. High-efficiency features like OFDMA and Target Wake Time (TWT) improve spectral efficiency, yet they cannot prevent network saturation when traffic demand simply outstrips the available airtime. To address this, we introduce an Airtime-Based Soft Call Admission Control (AS-CAC) framework designed specifically for saturated, multi-access point environments. Instead of relying on hard connection limits, our approach regulates access based on the actual airtime required by each flow. A key strategy is the "Soft-CAC" mechanism, which moves beyond static thresholds. It strictly prioritizes real-time streams like VoIP and Video but remains flexible enough to admit best-effort bursty traffic whenever spare capacity exists, maximizing channel utilization without breaking QoS guarantees. We validated this framework using extensive ns-3 simulations, backed by a theoretical multi-rate Erlang loss model to corroborate the findings. Results from dense deployment scenarios—including those with Co-Channel and Adjacent Channel Interference—show that AS-CAC stabilizes throughput and keeps end-to-end VoIP latency under 2 ms, a dramatic improvement over the 45+ ms delays seen in uncontrolled networks. Additionally, the Soft-CAC approach increased the admission rate for best-effort traffic by roughly 15% compared to strict partitioning, proving that it is possible to balance high spectral efficiency with rigorous QoS requirements. These findings offer a practical, scalable strategy for next-generation enterprise WLANs.
